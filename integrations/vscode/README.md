# Open in Ashlr MD — VS Code Extension

Open the active Markdown file in the **[Ashlr MD](https://md.ashlr.ai)** desktop
app — a beautiful, AI-native Markdown app — directly from VS Code.

> **Desktop-only.** Requires Ashlr MD installed so the `mdopener://` URL scheme
> is registered on your machine.

---

## What it does

| Entry point | Action |
|---|---|
| **Editor title-bar button** (link icon, Markdown files only) | Open the active file in Ashlr MD |
| **Command palette** → "Ashlr MD: Open in Ashlr MD" | Open the active Markdown file |

The button and command appear only when a Markdown file is active
(`resourceLangId == markdown`).

---

## How it works

The extension resolves the file's absolute on-disk path, URI-encodes it, and
opens the deep link:

```
mdopener://open?path=<encoded-absolute-path>
```

via `vscode.env.openExternal`. Ashlr MD registers this custom URL scheme and
brings the file up instantly (cold-starting the app if needed).

**CLI fallback.** If the deep link cannot be opened, the extension falls back to
spawning the bundled `mdopen` CLI:

```
mdopen <absolute-path>
```

The CLI path is configurable via the **`ashlr-md.cliPath`** setting (default
`mdopen`, resolved on your `PATH`). Install the CLI from inside Ashlr MD via the
**"Install CLI tool"** command.

### Edge cases handled

- **No active editor** — informational message.
- **Non-Markdown file** — informational message.
- **Untitled / never-saved file** — prompts you to save first (there is no
  on-disk path to hand off). Saved-but-dirty files open their last-saved
  on-disk version (the extension does not auto-save).

---

## Requirements

- **Ashlr MD** installed — [download here](https://md.ashlr.ai) — so the
  `mdopener://` scheme is registered.
- VS Code **1.85.0** or later.

---

## Build

```bash
cd integrations/vscode
npm install
npm run compile     # tsc → out/extension.js
```

Or with Bun:

```bash
bun install
bun run compile
```

### Package a `.vsix`

```bash
npm install -g @vscode/vsce   # one-time
npm run package               # → ashlr-md-vscode.vsix
```

---

## Install (from source)

1. Build (see above) so `out/extension.js` exists.
2. Either:
   - Open this `integrations/vscode/` folder in VS Code and press **F5** to
     launch an Extension Development Host, **or**
   - Run `npm run package` and install the resulting `.vsix` via
     **Extensions panel → ⋯ → Install from VSIX…**.

---

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ashlr-md.cliPath` | `mdopen` | Path to the `mdopen` CLI used as a fallback if the deep link cannot be opened. |

---

## Caveats

- **Ashlr MD must be installed.** If the `mdopener://` scheme is not registered
  and the `mdopen` CLI is not on `PATH`, the extension shows an error pointing
  to [md.ashlr.ai](https://md.ashlr.ai).
- **Not published to the Marketplace** yet — install from source / `.vsix`.
