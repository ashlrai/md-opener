//! Export helpers: write arbitrary bytes to disk atomically.
//!
//! Used by the DOCX export path (html-to-docx returns a binary Blob/ArrayBuffer
//! that cannot go through the text-oriented `write_markdown_file`).  The HTML
//! and PDF paths do not need this command.
//!
//! The atomic write strategy mirrors `document.rs`: write to a sibling temp
//! file first, then rename.  A rename on the same filesystem is atomic on
//! POSIX and near-atomic on Windows, so a crash mid-write never leaves a
//! truncated or corrupt file at the destination path.
